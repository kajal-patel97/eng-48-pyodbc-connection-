# Modules, Libraries and Packages
## --> Specifically pyodbc

### Libraries 
Referred to as Python standard libraries, they are standard with python but need to be imported.

### Modules 
These are Python files/like out MonsterStudent that we can import into our programs.
We create and import our own modules internally.

### Packages 
These are external modules, that we need to install (externally) and then import them.

These are modules usually written in OOP style, that abstract something.



These things that are abstracted include:
 - connection to a service (google maps, google image recognition api, price of stocks, price of bitcoin)
 - Tools or Calculators (prime number calculator, other complex calculators)
 - Front end tools (JS compiler or other things like scss)
 - Full fledged frameworks (frameworks are build on top of a language to build on top of things)
 - Connections to databases or using HTTP protocols.
 
#### Searching 
 - google
 - pypi.org - can be used to search for packages for python
 - Previous experience 
 -  Look at good git repos 
 - ---> analyse if its maintained and how and why you will use it.
 
#### Installing 
- pip - pythons package manager (deals with dependencies and installs in virtual environments ) - using the command line 
- pycharm - you can just add to interpreter 

#### Using 
- import and call your functions 
- follow the documentation
